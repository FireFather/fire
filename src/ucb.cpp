  Fire is a freeware UCI chess playing engine authored by Norman Schmidt.
  Fire utilizes many state-of-the-art chess programming ideas and techniques
  which have been documented in detail at https://www.chessprogramming.org/
  and demonstrated via the very strong open-source chess engine Stockfish...
