  Fire is a freeware UCI chess playing engine authored by Norman Schmidt.
  Fire utilizes many state-of-the-art chess programming ideas and techniques
  which have been documented in detail at https://www.chessprogramming.org/
  and demonstrated via the very strong open-source chess engine Stockfish...

  Thanks to Yu Nasu, Hisayori Noda. This implementation adapted from R. De Man
  and Daniel Shaw's Cfish nnue probe code https://github.com/dshawul/nnue-probe
