## features
- c++20
- windows & linux
- uci
- 64-bit
- smp (to 256 threads)
- alpha-beta search
- hash (to 1024 GB)
- ponder
- multiPV
- chess960 (Fischer Random)
- bench, perft & divide
- asychronous cout (acout) class using std::unique_lock<std::mutex>
- unique NNUE (halfkp_256x2-32-32) evaluation

## uci options
- **Hash** size of the hash table. default is 64 MB.
- **Threads** number of processor threads to use. default is 1, max = 128.
- **MultiPV** number of pv's/principal variations (lines of play) to be output. default is 1.
- **MoveOverhead** Adjust this to compensate for network and GUI latency. This is useful to avoid losses on time.
- **MinimumTime** Absolute minimum time (in ms) to spend on a single move. Also useful to avoid losses on time.
- **Ponder** also think during opponent's time. default is false.
- **UCI_Chess960** play chess960 (often called FRC or Fischer Random Chess). default is false.
- **Clear Hash** clear the hash table. delete allocated memory and re-initialize.

## binaries
- **x64 bmi2** = fast pgo binary (for modern 64-bit systems w/ BMI2 instruction set) if you own a modern Intel cpu (Haswell or newer), use this compile.
- **x64 avx2** = fast pgo binary (for modern 64-bit systems w/ AVX2 instruction set) if you own a modern AMD cpu, use this compile.

## compile it
- **windows** (visual studio) use included project files: Fire.vcxproj or Fire.sln
- **minGW** run one of the included shell scripts: make_bmi2.sh, make_avx2.sh, or make_all.sh 
- **ubuntu** type 'make profile-build ARCH=x86-64-bmi2', 'make profile-build ARCH=x86-64-avx2', etc.
